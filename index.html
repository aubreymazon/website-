			<h1>History of the Coffee House</h1>

			<div class="article-left">
				<p> The idea of this coffee house started with the owner herself. She's fond of drinking coffee and it is her all time favorite. <br> So, she started to think about the idea of Good Coffee Cafe. First, she thought where to build this coffee house. Where is the best place that suits the classic ambiance of the shop. And she chose to build it not that far from the city. The owner wants the future customers to feel relaxed and feel the calmness and peace while drinking their favorite coffee. Second, she considered the future design of the store. She wanted it to have a classic vibe with a touch of her soul. She wants the coffeeshop to have the aesthetic vibe that will surely attract customers.</p>

				<p> Then, she started searching for her future workers. To make the plan a success, she interviewed applicants who wants to apply for her coffee house. After few weeks of studying her applicants' resume, she chose the people whom she thinks is suited for the job that will be assigned in them. She also planned about her workers' salary every month. And finally, she planned for Good Coffee's menu. She wanted her coffees to be the best in terms of taste and plating. Finally, after all the plans, she needed money to start the construction of the coffee house and of course, to buy the little yet necessary details of the shop. Now, it is one of the coffee shops that is well known in San Fernando City, La Union. Risk takers are brave people. </p>
